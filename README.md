# [Crop Prediction System Using Machine Learning](https://pandukonala.github.io/blog-projects/crop/crop.html)
## Note
> Since the project is huge to upload in GitHub, I have compressed the project into multiple files. Download all and then extract.

## Overview
> This project is funded by Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. The Objective of the project is to Design and Development a Crop Prediction System using a Machine Learning algorithm(K-Means) in which the farmers are helped with a crop recommendation by knowing the type of the soil and location, the intended time of sowing and the crop type. Implemented using PHP & MySQL.

## Aim

>This project aims to create software that provides crop recommendations for a place given its location, the intended date of sowing and the crop type for the Japanese terrain.

## Functionalities
> The growth of plants depends upon their location of sowing, time of sowing and the weather. The location of the farm will tell us about its soil consumption and also the pests prevalent in the area. The location and time will together give us an idea about the weather in that location. All crops for proper growth, have their own ideal soil nutrient compositions and pest resistance.

## Modules
> • Interface creation for crop table management where the farmer will enter his her location
							<br>
							• Storing the details of location, soil, nutrients, weather, crops, pests in a well-defined database
							<br>
							• Predicting the best suitable crop based on the data stored in the database

## Conclusion
> This system helps the farmer to predict whether the crop is fit for that location and time, and besides, the software will also suggest its recommendations to further inform upon alternate options that may be possible be of better value. This project will be designed to be a web-based application since the main use of this application would-be farmers and farmers have to access this from remote locations.
